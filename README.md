# Land Registry (Solidity Smart Contract)

A decentralized land registry system built with Solidity. It allows users to:

Register land parcels with unique IDs, location, and area.

Transfer ownership securely between parties.

Query land details and verify if a parcel is registered.

This contract demonstrates a simple blockchain-based property management system where ownership and records are transparent and immutable.
